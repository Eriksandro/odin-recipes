    <h2>Ingredientes</h2>
    <p>Unless you live in the Northeast, beef "tips" are not something you see on menus very often. That's a shame, since they areone of the great, meaty comfort foods of all time. Having said that, we've all had beef tips before, except it was probably called "stew." I don't want to get bogged down in semantics, but to me the main differences between the two terms are where the meat comes from and how it's cut.</p>
    <p>Based on my experience, "tips" are smaller trimmings cut from pieces of meat that weren't big enough to make larger chunks of "stew meat." Nowadays, beef tips can come from any cut, but for obvious financial reasons, your average truck stop is using something cheap, lean, and tough (so that's what I went with here). There's something very satisfying about making these types of cuts succulent and delicious. The keysare incorporating enough fat into the final product and cooking it long enough.</p>
